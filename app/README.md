# ðŸ”¥ Z-App

> v.0.0.2, Shell

This is a demo app created using [create-z-project](https://github.com/Z-Js-Framework/create-z-project), a quick way to start building with z, with recommended project structure and example patterns.

ðŸ’¡ For full documentation on how to use z js, see [Z Js Framework Docs](https://github.com/javaScriptKampala/z-js)

## Installing And Having It Running

you don't need a lot, just run...

``` bash
npm install
```

And then run with

```bash
npm run dev
```

What other thing do you think we can add to **create-z-project** ? or anything, otherwise have fun!
